# **CrowdcCounting and Density Estimation**

## **purpose**
The purpose of this code is to estimate the number of people in an image using simple image processing techniques. It does this by identifying and counting human-shaped contours in a scene, such as a photo of a crowd. This lightweight approach is suitable for basic crowd estimation where the use of complex models like deep learning may not be feasible.

## **Technologies Used**
•	Python: General-purpose programming language used to write the script.
•	OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. Used here for:
•	Reading and processing images
•	Converting images to grayscale
•	Applying thresholding and morphological operations
•	Detecting contours
•	NumPy: Python library for numerical computations. Used for creating structuring elements (kernels) in image processing.

## **Usage**
*Prerequisites *Install the required Python libraries if not already installed:

## **Conclusion**
 This program provides a basic, fast, and lightweight method to estimate the number of people in an image using classic image processing techniques. 
 It’s suitable for quick approximations in controlled environments where people are clearly distinguishable. However, due to the simplicity of the method, it may struggle with:
•	Complex backgrounds
•	Dense or overlapping crowds
•	Varying lighting conditions
For higher accuracy in more challenging scenarios, consider integrating advanced object detection models like YOLO, SSD, or using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
